## Instalation

Clone this repository in folder root from your server or any folder if use Docker
```
git clone https://github.com/
```
In the folder where you clone the project, run composer to download the Laravel dependencies
```
php composer install
```
or with Docker 
```
docker run --rm -i   -v /$(PWD):/app  composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-scripts
```
### Only to docker
Pull images and mount the container
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Docker will use [docker-compose](https://github.com/PedroHSDias/nr-challenge/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to mount 
By default the [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) used to mount the container not have all requirements for laravel, so it's necessary execute the  following steps:
To see containers id: 
```
docker ps
```

## Database
Use the script in [create_db.sql](https://github.com/PedroHSDias/nr-challenge/blob/master/create_db.sql) to create a database

Change the DB configuration in [.env](https://github.com/PedroHSDias/nr-challenge/blob/master/.env) to use database

# Now its ready
Access http://localhost/public/ or configure a v-host to folder public in project
    
In first access all in screen its a te name "Raspagem" and a link named "Busca tudo CNPQ"

To execute the crawler just click in "Busca tudo CNPQ", when the aplication will visiti all pages in http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/licitacoes and get some informations from biddings and save in DB. The files refers appends in this biddings will be save in local host, folder [storage/app/public](https://github.com/PedroHSDias/nr-challenge/tree/master/storage/app/public).
Because the massive amount of information a (currently have more tan 1400 records, more than 1tb of appends)  this process can take some minutes.

# The code 

The scripts more important in this project can be found in [business](https://github.com/PedroHSDias/nr-challenge/tree/master/app/Business) folder, they can be easily adapted to cli, persist in database and download appends to server are optional
